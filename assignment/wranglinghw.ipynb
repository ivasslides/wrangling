First, changing them to floats from strings allows descriptive statistics - such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles ranges, etc - to be performed on this column. Second, rounding to two decimal places increases the readability of the column, but still preserves the values as they were inputted. Additionally, looking at the `SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent` variable, we can see that there are 5 different categories of Sentence Type. Using a cross table, we can look at the relationship between the two variables and see if there are any correlation between the 5 different types of Sentence Type and the Imposed Sentence. "

Another aspect that could be improved is having less political interference or impact on the census. Having political pressure and controversy involved with the census might dissuade some people from participating, which is the opposite of the goal of the census. \n",

Some of the Census' good practices could definitely be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data. One of these practices, such as having multiple ways for people to respond, could be adopted for healthcare and academic surveys. Having multiple options allows people to pick the one that works best for then, and might prompt more people to participate in that survey. \n"

People might choose to not answer these questions, and therefore contribute to missing values, for many different reasons. These different reasons should not all be grouped into one category, however it might be hard to discover the reasons each person has for not answering. A good practice people might have would be to give a specific reason for not answering a question, or just answering it in the first place. A bad practice people might have would be choosing not to answer certain questions for no reason, or not answering the questions truthfully.
